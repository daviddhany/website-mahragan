## Student ID Format

```text
[Gender Code][Class Code]-[Year]-[Number]
```

Examples:

```text
BY-2026-0001 = male student in John class
GS-2026-0001 = female student in Philo class

```

## Important Production Notes

Before using this with real student data:

- Use HTTPS.
- Change SESSION_SECRET.
- Change the default admin password.
- Do not expose uploads publicly without access controls.
- Use a secure MongoDB account and network restrictions.
- Back up the database regularly.
